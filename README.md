This repository contains a JavaScript file with code for a simple web page navigation and authentication functionality.

Code Explanation
The JavaScript code in this file handles the following functionality:

Variable Declarations: The code starts by declaring variables for various DOM elements, such as the hamburger icon, mobile navigation, signup button, login button, signup modal, and login modal.

Hamburger Icon Event Listener: An event listener is added to the hamburger icon, which toggles the "active" and "transform-white" classes on the hamburger icon element and calls the mobileNavRender() function.

Signup Form Event Listeners: Event listeners are added to the signup button, bottom signup button, and mobile signup link, which call the signup() function when clicked.

Signup Function: The signup() function toggles the "active" class on the signup modal element and replaces its HTML content with a signup form.

Login Form Event Listeners: Event listeners are added to the login button, bottom login button, and mobile login link, which call the login() function when clicked.

Login Function: The login() function toggles the "active" class on the login modal element and replaces its HTML content with a login form.

Mobile Nav Render Function: The mobileNavRender() function toggles the "active" class on the mobile navigation element.
